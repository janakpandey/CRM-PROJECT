### Prerequisites

1. Python and Django: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install Django using pip:
```python
pip install django
```

2. Database: Decide on the database you want to use. By default, Django uses SQLite, but you can configure it to use other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle.

3. Text Editor or IDE: Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your preference. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.

### Setting Up Your Django Project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```python
django-admin startproject seproject
cd seproject
python manage.py startapp RecordApp
```

We've created a new project named "SE_Project" and an app named "RecordApp."

### Application Registration: you need to configure in your settings.py file

Make sure your app (myapp) is included in the INSTALLED_APPS list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'myapp',
]
```

Run the following commands to create the migrations and apply them:

```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
